# Authentication-App
- Basic app in which I practiced concepts of user authentication.
- This is a simple app which uses a dummy backend database of Firebase, and operates as a Sign In / Log In page for users.

### Subjects covered
- Using Firebase Authentication backend API tool in order to allow users to sign in and log in to the database.
- Hooks such as: useHistory to redirect the user to another page and / or to restrict navigation to a certain amount.
- Use of the localStorage (which is a feature of JavaScript and built inside the browser)
in order to set/get/remove items from the storage (a more secure way than using cookies), by selecting the specified key.
- Understanding the way authentication works, while in each request to store data in the backend the user
details are encrypted with a unique token ID (in this case generated by the Firebase internal algorithms and not by myself).
